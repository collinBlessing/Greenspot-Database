# Greenspot Database Project

## Explanation of my Solution

**Project Objective:** The Greenspot Database Project aims to create a comprehensive and efficient database system for a fictional business, Greenspot. My project addresses the need to streamline inventory tracking, provide insights into customer preferences, and support business expansion by maintaining data accuracy.

**Key Features:** The project encompasses the creation of three crucial tables: Vendor, Customer, and Inventory. The Vendor table stores information about suppliers, the Customer table tracks customer details, and the Inventory table records product data. Key features include maintaining data integrity through foreign key constraints, tracking product quantities, and supporting data retrieval for inventory management.

**Findings or Results:** Through this project, I've established a robust database system that allows Greenspot to efficiently manage its inventory. While no specific data analysis was conducted, the system is well-prepared to provide insights into sales trends and product preferences in the future.

## Description of my Approach

### Methodology

I employed MySQL as the relational database management system. I created the three essential tables and established foreign key relationships to ensure data consistency. SQL queries were utilized to insert sample data into the tables and test the database's functionality.

### Design Choices

The database was designed with the principles of normalization to minimize data redundancy and maintain consistency. I incorporated foreign keys to connect the Customer and Vendor tables to the Inventory table, providing referential integrity. The database schema structure is intuitive, ensuring ease of use and scalability for future business expansion.

### Testing

Testing involved running SQL queries to insert, update, and retrieve data. I ensured that the foreign key constraints worked correctly and that data could be retrieved efficiently to support business operations.

### Challenges

The main challenge encountered during the project was resolving foreign key constraints while inserting data. To address this, I ensured that the referenced values in the Customer and Vendor tables matched the ones used in the Inventory table. This required careful data entry to maintain referential integrity.
